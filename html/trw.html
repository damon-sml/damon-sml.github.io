              <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Northrop
              Grumman Corporation (NGC) made an unsolicited bid of US$5.9
              billion to acquire TRW. With the
              assumption of debt, the bid value totals US$11.4 billion. TRW
              responded to the offer with a brief statement saying its board of
              directors would meet to decide the appropriate course of
              action. TRW has advised its shareholders to take no action
              while it considers the offer.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">TRW has been the
              subject of takeover speculation for years. Northrop Grumman's
              offer was probably prompted by the unexpected departure on
              February 19 of TRW's former chief executive officer, David Cote.
              Other likely bidders for TRW might include Boeing, General
              Dynamics, Goodrich and Lockheed Martin. Offers from General
              Dynamics or Goodrich would likely face less scrutiny from
              government regulators than a merger of TRW with Boeing or Lockheed
              Martin. Other companies which might also be interested in TRW are
              Alliant TechSystems Inc., L3 Communications Holdings Corp. and
              GenCorp's Aerojet propulsion business. (GenCorp sold Aerojet's
              electronic information systems business to Northrop Grumman in
              2001.) TRW may respond by issuing a break-up plan of its own. If
              separated, TRW's defense business could attract higher value.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">If the merger
              were to be approved it would result in four major defense
              contractors of roughly equal size: Northrop Grumman, Lockheed
              Martin Corp., Boeing Co. and Raytheon Co. The merger could also
              start a new round of consolidation in the industry if smaller
              companies start to consider mergers, or if other bidders for TRW
              emerge.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Under terms of
              the offer, Northrop Grumman would exchange US$47 in stock for each
              TRW share, an 18 percent premium over the company's closing share
              price of US$39.80. Based on the February 21 closing price </font><font size="3" face="Arial">on
              the NYSE</font><font size="3" face="Arial">, Northrop is offering
              0.398 of its shares for each TRW share. Northrop Grumman would
              also assume about US$5.5 billion of TRW debt. Immediately
              following the close of the transaction, Northrop Grumman would
              sell or spin-off TRW's automotive business. Excluding TRW's
              automotive business, Northrop Grumman projects combined 2003 sales
              of approximately US$26 to 27 billion. The debt-to-capital ratio
              for Northrop Grumman would be at 40 percent by the end of 2002.
              TRW had 2001 sales of US$16.4 billion. TRW's automotive parts
              business accounted for 64 percent of TRW's sales and 58 percent of
              profits. <o:p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Northrop Grumman
              has about 100,000 employees in 44 states and 25 countries. TRW has
              about 94,000 workers. About 30,000 of TRW's employees have jobs
              with business units Northrop Grumman wants to keep, and there are
              no widespread job cuts expected in those divisions. <o:p>

              </font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Northrop Grumman
              would benefit most from TRW's satellite production unit, which
              makes satellites used by the military for observation and to
              coordinate the movement of troops, ships and airplanes. TRW has
              built nearly 200 spacecraft. TRW has also been involved in the
              U.S. ballistic missile program for nearly 50 years, and is the
              Pentagon's prime contractor for intercontinental ballistic
              missiles.<o:p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Northrop Grumman
              has made 14 acquisitions since 1994. In 2001 it acquired Newport
              News Shipbuilding for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>US$2.1
              billion. Also, in 2001 it paid US$3.8 billion to acquire Litton
              Industries. In 1998 Lockheed Martin attempted to purchase Northrop
              Grumman, but abandoned its plans in the face of U.S. antitrust
              concerns.<o:p>
